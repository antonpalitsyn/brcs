Since we are using Bootstrap, the amount of SCSS is very minimal.

You can upload any CSV with any number of columns and it will create the table dynamically. The first row of a CSV represents the header however, so the expectation is for the first row to contain column titles. I included two examples in the "cvs" folder in the root of the project.
